synopsis:           Types whose single value is loaded with an effect.
description:
    This is a library for handling resources.

    The idea is that for each resource file separate from Haskell code, there's
    a Haskell datatype that corresponds to it in the code itself. And those
    datatypes have a single value: the loaded and parsed resource, which is
    accessed through an effectful action.
